# Bengali Speech-based Medical Assistant Using RAG

## 📌 Overview
This is my BSc CSE thesis project at East Delta University.  
It is a **Bengali speech-driven medical assistant** that uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** for symptom-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

## 🗂 Contents
- **`Dataset for thesis.xlsx`** — Medical dataset with diseases, symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatments in Bengali.
- **`bengali_medical_assistant.ipynb`** — Google Colab notebook for dataset preprocessing, RAG integration, and speech recognition.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 Bengali speech recognition
- 🩺 Symptom-based disease identification
- 📚 RAG-based retrieval for accurate responses
- 🌐 Bengali language output for accessibility

> **Note:** A valid **Gemini API key** is required and must be stored securely as a secret (`.env` or Colab environment variables).
